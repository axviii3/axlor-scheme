# AXTRO - Color Palette/Scheme

### TL;DR
Axtro is a warm retro color palette/scheme for use in personal art work and 
as a UI theme in some applications

### Inspiration
I usually use colorschemes like One Dark and Carppuccin which have more 
modern and pastel-y color palettes. But I had an interest in looking at some 
retro palettes to see what they looked like. I really liked the aesthetic 
of heavily saturated warm tones and faded cooler tones in some retro themes. 
I also realised that most people do not use eye-protection coloring which 
basically tints the screen in some warm color which gives the retro schemes 
a different kind of charm. So I decided I'll make one myself which is warm 
without eye-protection. Mostly based on Gruvbox and Vim's Retrobox and 
pinterest scrolling.

### Why
I use eye-protection myself which gives all colours on my screen a warmer 
tone which looks especially charming with retro palettes. But most people 
either do not use this feature or have it dialed low. I have mine cranked up 
to 3000 kelvin temperature which is equivalent to this shade of orange

multiplied to the screen color at approximately 55% opacity. However making 
colorscheme and treating it with that orange will ruin it for people who 
also use eye-protection as that would make the colors too warm. I tried to 
find a good middle ground with this palette. And maybe even later 
seperate warm and cool versions of the palette as many color schemes do

### Possible Improvements
* Better brightness adjustment
* Better separation between cooler colors
* Tweaking the neutral scale (which is grayscale but slightly tinted)

### Ports
* Neovim ~ Planned
* Bash Prompt ~ Planned
